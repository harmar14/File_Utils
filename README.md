# File_Utils
Sometimes when working with files it's easier to write a script than to work by hand...

# remove_repeats.py
Imagine there are two folders in the same directory and you want to compare structures in them.
The task is to delete files from the first folder which exist in the second folder. Folders should not be deleted.
This script may help you with it!
