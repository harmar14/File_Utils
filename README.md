# remove_repeats.py
Imagine there are two folders in the same directory and you want to compare structures in them.
The task is to delete files from the first folder which exist in the second folder. Inner folders should not be deleted.
This script may help you with it!

# structure_update.py
If there are two (main) folders with similar inner structures, we can compare them and move missing files and folders from one main folder to another.
That's what this script may be used for.
